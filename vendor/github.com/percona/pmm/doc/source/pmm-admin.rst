**DETAILED DESCRIPTION**

When adding the MySQL query analytics service,
the ``pmm-admin`` tool will attempt to automatically detect
the local MySQL instance and MySQL superuser credentials.
You can use options to provide this information,
if it cannot be detected automatically.

You can also specify the ``--create-user`` option to create a dedicated
``pmm`` user on the MySQL instance that you want to monitor.
This user will be given all the necessary privileges for monitoring,
and is recommended over using the MySQL superuser.

For example, to set up remote monitoring of QAN data
on a MySQL server located at 192.168.200.2,
use a command similar to the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo pmm-admin add mysql:queries --user root --password root --host 192.168.200.2 --create-user

QAN can use either the slow query log or Performance Schema as the source.
By default, it chooses the slow query log for a local MySQL instance
and Performance Schema otherwise.
For more information about the differences, see :ref:`perf-schema`.

You can explicitely set the query source when adding a QAN instance
using the ``--query-source`` option.

For more information, run ``sudo pmm-admin add mysql:queries --help``.

  Performs a connection performance test to see the latency
  from *PMM Client* to *PMM Server*.

* ``Client <-- Server``

  Checks the status of Prometheus endpoints
  and makes sure it can scrape metrics from corresponding exporters.

  Successful pings of *PMM Server* from *PMM Client*
  do not mean that Prometheus is able to scrape from exporters.
  If the output shows some endpoints in problem state,
  make sure that the corresponding service is running
  (see |pmm-admin-list|_).
  If the services that correspond to problematic endpoints are running,
  make sure that firewall settings on the *PMM Client* host
  allow incoming connections for corresponding ports.

.. _pmm-admin-start:

Starting monitoring services
============================

Use the ``pmm-admin start`` command to start services
managed by this *PMM Client*.

**USAGE**

.. code-block:: text

   pmm-admin start [SERVICE [NAME]] [OPTIONS]

.. note:: It should be able to detect the local *PMM Client* name,
   but you can also specify it explicitly as an argument.

**OPTIONS**

The following option can be used with the ``pmm-admin start`` command:

``--all``
  Start all monitoring services.

You can also use
:ref:`global options that apply to any other command
<pmm-admin-options>`.

**SERVICES**

Specify a :ref:`monitoring service alias <pmm-admin-service-aliases>`
that you want to start.
To see which services are available, run |pmm-admin-list|_.

**EXAMPLES**

* To start all available services for this *PMM Client*:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo pmm-admin start --all

* To start all services related to MySQL:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo pmm-admin start mysql

* To start only MongoDB metrics service:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo pmm-admin start mongodb:metrics

For more information, run ``sudo pmm-admin start --help``.

.. _pmm-admin-stop:

Stopping monitoring services
============================

Use the ``pmm-admin stop`` command to stop services
managed by this *PMM Client*.

**USAGE**

.. code-block:: text

   pmm-admin stop [SERVICE [NAME]] [OPTIONS]

.. note:: It should be able to detect the local *PMM Client* name,
   but you can also specify it explicitly as an argument.

**OPTIONS**

The following option can be used with the ``pmm-admin stop`` command:

``--all``
  Stop all monitoring services.

You can also use
:ref:`global options that apply to any other command
<pmm-admin-options>`.

**SERVICES**

Specify a :ref:`monitoring service alias <pmm-admin-service-aliases>`
that you want to stop.
To see which services are available, run |pmm-admin-list|_.

**EXAMPLES**

* To stop all available services for this *PMM Client*:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo pmm-admin stop --all

* To stop all services related to MySQL:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo pmm-admin stop mysql

* To stop only MongoDB metrics service:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo pmm-admin stop mongodb:metrics

For more information, run ``sudo pmm-admin stop --help``.

.. _pmm-admin-uninstall:

Cleaning up PMM Client before uninstall
=======================================

Use the ``pmm-admin uninstall`` command to remove all services
even if *PMM Server* is not available.
To uninstall PMM correctly, you first need to remove all services,
then uninstall *PMM Client*,
and then stop and remove *PMM Server*.
However, if *PMM Server* is not available (disconnected or shut down),
|pmm-admin-rm|_ will not work.
In this case, you can use ``pmm-admin uninstall``
to force the removal of monitoring services enabled for *PMM Client*.

.. note:: Information about services will remain in *PMM Server*,
   and it will not let you add those services again.
   To remove information about orphaned services from *PMM Server*,
   once it is back up and available to *PMM Client*,
   use the |pmm-admin-repair|_ command.

**USAGE**

.. code-block:: text

   pmm-admin uninstall [OPTIONS]

**OPTIONS**

The ``pmm-admin uninstall`` command does not have its own options,
but you can use :ref:`global options that apply to any other command
<pmm-admin-options>`.

For more information, run ``sudo pmm-admin uninstall --help``.

.. _pmm-admin-service-aliases:

Monitoring Service Aliases
==========================

The following aliases are used to designate PMM services
that you want to :ref:`add <pmm-admin-add>`, :ref:`remove <pmm-admin-rm>`,
:ref:`restart <pmm-admin-restart>`,
:ref:`start <pmm-admin-start>`, or :ref:`stop <pmm-admin-stop>`:
